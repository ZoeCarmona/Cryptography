# Cryptography Programs

This repository contains implementations of classical cryptographic algorithms for my Cryptography course.

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Caesar Cipher

A classical substitution cipher that shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
It uses modular arithmetic and ASCII manipulation to encode and decode messages.

## How to Run

```bash
python name_of_program.py
